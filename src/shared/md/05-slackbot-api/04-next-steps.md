If you have extra time, interest or ambition a few extra things to explore in Slack:

- **Sign in with Slack** is helpful for authenticating (and possibly associating) a Slack user account with a another system
- **Options URL** for creating interactive menus (known almost everywhere else in the software world as drop downs)
- **Dialogs** for grouping together form elements into a singleâ€¦form
