# Intro to AWS

---
## Amazon.com

- Founded 1994
- Internet retailer and electronics manufacter
- Book store? Grocery store? Everything Store
- The original _Cloud Vendor_ ðŸŒ¦

---
## Amazon Web Services

- Founded 2002 as a subsidiary of [Amazon.com](https://amazon.com)
- Relaunched in 2006 with: S3, SQS and EC2

---
## ðŸ“ˆ  Epic Growth 
- In 2015, [Amazon.com reported AWS was profitable](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32442268), with sales of $1.57 billion in the first quarter of the year 
- AWS is predicted to have $13 billion in revenue in 2017

---
## Marketplace Dominance

[Gartner estimated in 2015](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2G2O5FC&ct=150519&st=sb) that AWS customers are deploying 10x more infrastructure on AWS than the combined adoption of the next 14 providers

## Cloud Vendor Philosphy

If you really want to understand AWS you need to read this [blog post from Werner Vogels](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2016/03/10-lessons-from-10-years-of-aws.html) 

---
## AWS Pioneered IaaS

- Dominates the market it mostly created
- New players are emmerging

---
## Evaluate and Monitor

- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform

---
## Cloud Compute History

Servers &rarr; Virtual Machines &rarr; Containers &rarr; _Functions_

---
## Physical Servers

- Servers are hard to scale; you can only go so far vertically
- We solved that by making commodity servers and stacking them horizontally
- They commodified to the point that renting them became more cost effective
 
---
## ðŸ‘¾ Virtual Machines

- Eventually we rented virtual machines; small slices of the old physical pie
- Virtual machines are large, difficult to manage/update/backup/etc, they are slow to startup

---
## ðŸ‘¾ðŸ‘¾  Containers
- Share the benefits of VMs 
- Coldstart speed is in milliseconds

---
## Servers Stuff Happensâ€¦

- Stuff goes down &rarr; region and/or provider failover time in a DNS window
- Stuff gets throttled &rarr; retrys and timeouts are par for the course
- Stuff gets spiked &rarr; means you have to figure out load balancing big ass fleets of servers
- Stuff gets shipped &rarr; means you have to have zero downtime deploys of those big ass fleets of servers

---
## Flashback to 2014

AWS Lambda ships in 2014 the idea that the **smallest unite of compute is a Function**

---
It is important to notice the _server_ metaphor is not longer the baseline infrastructure primative for compute in this model

<strike>Servers</strike> &rarr; <strike>Virtual Machines</strike> &rarr; <strike>Containers</strike> &rarr; Functions

---
## Functions âœ…

- Makes dynamic backend compute deployment akin to static website deployment
- Functions offer perfect and total isolation
- Completely managed, and thus predictable, if modestly opaque, runtime

---
## Functions âœ…

- Deployments are in seconds, instantly available to theoretical infinate load
- Isolation means these are super antifragile systems; downtime is hard to achieve 
- Configuration can be very lightweight and more portable

---
## Functions Limits

- Timeouts still happen but you can tune them to a 5 minute window
- Throttles still happen; only 1000 concurrent requests are allowed

---
## Pricing 

1st million invocations are free and then its $0.10 per million invocations thereafter. That means 10 million invocations is under $1 a month.
