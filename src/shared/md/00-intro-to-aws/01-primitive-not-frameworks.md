## Preface: Mental Models

In physics we describe light in terms of particals and waves. Neither of these things are precisely true but both are useful *models* for thinking about how light works.

## Preface: Mental Models
A mental model is way of approaching thinking around a how a particular idea or topic works. It is a technique of self directed empathy to aide in understanding complex systems better and make better decisions for creating desirable outcomes in those systems.

## Primitives not Framworks

This is a fantastic mental model for the serverless renaissance introduced by Werner Vogals, CTO of Amazon.

## Primitives not Frameworks

Talk about what werner meant here.

## AWS Primitives

- Compute
- Blob storage
- Database persistence
- HTTP gateway
- Messaging

---
## Primitives

- Compute &rarr; runtime for all your business logic
- Blog storage &rarr; static assets, coldstorage of data, etc
- Database persistence &rarr; structured data
- HTTP gateway &rarr; talk to the world
- Messaging &rarr; background tasks

## Managed vs Unmanged

- Transparent vs Opaque
- Security
- Performance
- Scale

Can your business commodatize these vectors faster and cheaper than AWS?

## Primitives as a Service

A better PaaS? *
<style>
table#c tr th {
  font-size:.6em;
}
table#c tr td {
  font-size:.6em;
}
</style>
<table width=100% id=c>
<tr> 
  <th style=width:150px;>Primitive</th>
  <th style=width:150px;>Product</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Compute</td>
  <td>Lambda</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Blob storage</td>
  <td>S3</td>

<tr>
  <td>Compute</td>
  <td>Lambda</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Database</td>
  <td>DynamoDB</td>

<tr>
  <td>HTTP gateway</td>

## Important!

AWS is much more serverless than just these services:

- Lambda
- S3
- DynamoDB
- API Gateway, CloudFront, Route53
- SNS

## Patterns are Mental Models

- Introduced in the new well worn GoF
- Most of these things go by a few names; sometimes differ between languages/runtimes and/or get built-in

Underlying principle: we can follow a pattern to solve a particular class of problem

## Old Patterns are New Again

Flyweight &rarr; Fan out

---
## Composition over Inheritance 

- âœ… Primitives are flexable and compose to powerful solutions
- âœ… Frameworks tradeoff flexability for deliberate constraint
- âœ… Frameworks themselves are composed of Primitives; oft by way Patterns

---
## Primitives &rarr; Patterns &rarr; App

Building an **App** is building a non generalized **Framework** for your **Product**

## Spoiler: *Ops: Still A Thing

- Devops is about shattering the barrier between dev and delivery
- Cloud tech brings delivery right to the doorstep of dev
- Loose collection of principles and ever-changing implementing practices *

<blockquote style=width:100%;font-size:.5em;>
* The cloud does not negate principles; it's just a new player in our ever-changing implementing practices
