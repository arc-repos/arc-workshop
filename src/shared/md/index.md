# Master AWS on Easy Mode with https://arc.codes

> Cloud functions have taken tech by storm! 

- Scale transparently with no concept of clusters or load balancing or infra provisioning
- Isolated logic so debugging is super easy and side effects constrained
- Only pay for the compute you use (100% utilization)
- Deploy instantly with zero downtime

However getting started is frought with complexity and configuration. In this workshop you will quickly learn all the angles of 'serverless' technology using Amazon Web Services tamed with JSF Architect. 

This workshop explores end to end development and deployment of four exercises:

- Website on a custom domain with user authentication and state 
- Function that executes on an interval updating a database record
- A basic JSON API for doing typical database CRUD
- Slack app that responds to slash commands or @ mentions

### Prerequisites

- Comfortable with JavaScript
- Experience with the Node runtime
- Node `8.9.1` and npm `5.5.1` (NOTE: Lambda currently runs Node `6.10.x`)
- npm account (ideally private modules)
- Github account (ideally private repos)
- Codeship account (free tier is ðŸ†’)
- Amazon Web Services account
- AWS `~/.aws/credentials` setup
- Willingness to buy a domain on Route53
